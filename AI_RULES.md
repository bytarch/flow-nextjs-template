# AI Development Rules

This document outlines the technology stack and specific library usage guidelines for this Next.js application. Adhering to these rules will help maintain consistency, improve collaboration, and ensure the AI assistant can effectively understand and modify the codebase.

## Tech Stack Overview

The application is built using the following core technologies:

*   **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) ‚Äî **Client-Side Only**
*   **Language**: TypeScript
*   **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI - A collection of re-usable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **Icons**: Lucide React - A comprehensive library of simply beautiful SVG icons.
*   **Forms**: React Hook Form for managing form state and validation, typically with Zod for schema validation.
*   **State Management**: Primarily React Context API and built-in React hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`).
*   **Notifications/Toasts**: Sonner for displaying non-intrusive notifications.
*   **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization.
*   **Animation**: `tailwindcss-animate` and animation capabilities built into Radix UI components.

## Library Usage Guidelines

To ensure consistency and leverage the chosen stack effectively, please follow these rules:

1.  **UI Components**:
    *   **Primary Choice**: Always prioritize using components from the `src/components/ui/` directory (Shadcn/UI components).
    *   **Custom Components**: If a required component is not available in Shadcn/UI, create a new component in `src/components/` following Shadcn/UI's composition patterns (i.e., building on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS).
    *   **Avoid**: Introducing new, third-party UI component libraries without discussion.

2.  **Styling**:
    *   **Primary Choice**: Exclusively use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all styling.
    *   **Global Styles**: Reserve `src/app/globals.css` for base Tailwind directives, global CSS variable definitions, and minimal base styling. Avoid adding component-specific styles here.
    *   **CSS-in-JS**: Do not use CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., Styled Components, Emotion).

3.  **Icons**:
    *   **Primary Choice**: Use icons from the `lucide-react` library.

4.  **Forms**:
    *   **Management**: Use `react-hook-form` for all form logic (state, validation, submission).
    *   **Validation**: Use `zod` for schema-based validation with `react-hook-form` via `@hookform/resolvers`.

5.  **State Management**:
    *   **Local State**: Use React's `useState` and `useReducer` hooks for component-level state.
    *   **Shared/Global State**: For state shared between multiple components, prefer React Context API.
    *   **Complex Global State**: If application state becomes significantly complex, discuss the potential introduction of a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai) before implementing.

6.  **Routing**:
    *   Utilize the Next.js App Router (file-system based routing in the `src/app/` directory) **in client components only**.
    *   **STRICT ROUTING POLICY**:  
        üö´ **Absolutely forbid** the use of dynamic route segments like `/details/[id]`.  
        ‚ùå No exceptions ‚Äî `/details/[id]` and similar patterns are banned.  
        ‚úÖ Instead, always pass identifiers via query parameters:  
        ```
        /details?id=123
        ```
        This ensures URL structure consistency, avoids server-driven routing, and keeps the application purely client-side.

7.  **API Calls & Data Fetching**:
    *   **Client-Side Only**: All data fetching must be done **exclusively in client components** using external APIs. No server components, server routes, or server logic are allowed.
    *   **External-Only APIs**: The application must **not** create or depend on any internal API routes or server-side handlers.
    *   **Fetch Method**: Use the native `fetch` API or a simple wrapper to call external endpoints directly from the browser.
    *   **No Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Props**: Do not use `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, or any Next.js server functions for data fetching. All pages must be static or client-rendered.
    *   **User API Requirement**: If the user does not have an API, inform them they must create one for the application to function.
    *   **Neon Hosting Note**: If hosting on Neon's platform, backend APIs must be implemented in PHP, as this is the supported backend language on their hosting panel.

8.  **Animations**:
    *   Use `tailwindcss-animate` plugin and the animation utilities provided by Radix UI components.

9.  **Notifications/Toasts**:
    *   Use the `Sonner` component (from `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`) for all toast notifications.

10. **Charts & Data Visualization**:
    *   Use `recharts` and its associated components (e.g., `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`) for displaying charts.

11. **Utility Functions**:
    *   General-purpose helper functions should be placed in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
    *   Ensure functions are well-typed and serve a clear, reusable purpose.

12. **Custom Hooks**:
    *   Custom React hooks should be placed in the `src/hooks/` directory (e.g., `src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx`).

13. **TypeScript**:
    *   Write all new code in TypeScript.
    *   Strive for strong typing and leverage TypeScript's features to improve code quality and maintainability. Avoid using `any` where possible.
